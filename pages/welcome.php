		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
			<h2>Welcome to ConULearn</h2>
			<h3>We are here to help students of Concordia University get the best learning experience.
			Our team consists of eight highly qualified Concordia undergraduate students: Wei He, Lunecy Appadoo, Orel Moisa, Jean-Michel Laliberte, Sophia Quach, Alex Zhang, Helen Zhang and Robert Nam Quang Nguyen.
			Dividing our team into front-end and back-end developers, we are able to create easy to use features.
			Our main goal is to provide Concordia faculty members with a reliable resource to assess their students progression while enabling them to acquire knowledge through engagements in discussions.
			</h3>
		</br>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<h3>The quiz dates will be announced by the course instructors, after which students will be able to prepare by learning the appropriate material.
			If any questions come up, the discussion board will be available for use. 
			Professors will then post quizzes that will contain multiple choice questions and short or long answer questions.
			Once all the students submit their quizzes, it's time for grading!
			The students will then receive feedback where they will be able to revise their work and learn from their mistakes.</h3>
