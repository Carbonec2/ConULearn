# Coding Style Rules

### Id's / class names/ method names / variable names
- Always use meaningful identifier name
- Starts with a lower case
- Separated by a upper case or an underscore if it contains more than two words
- Should not contain a '-'
- Must not be longer than 4 words.
- In the style.css file, always add a space after the id/class name and the opening curly brace
- When an identifier name is the most meaningful one but is already taken, add a digit after the variable name

### Readability of the codes
- Always move to a newline (carriage return) after an opening curly brace
- When closing a method with a curly brace, close it on a newline
- Always move to a new line after finishing with a ';'
- Always close the div tag on a new line and align it with its opening tag.
- Always use curly braces when using an if statement (even if it is not required)
